<h5>Spending Philosophy</h5>
<p class="mb-5">Saving money and investing money are two distinct approaches to managing personal finances, with distinct goals and benefits. Saving money is the act of setting aside a portion of income for emergency situations or future expenses, typically in a low-risk savings account or other low-risk vehicles. On the other hand, investing money involves putting funds into different types of assets, such as stocks, mutual funds, and even real estate, with the goal of gaining more money over the long-term. Investing is often considered a better approach to growing wealth compared to saving for several reasons. The average historical return for the stock market has been approximately 10% per year, which is significantly higher than the average interest rate offered by savings accounts. By investing, individuals can potentially grow their wealth over time and achieve their long-term financial goals, whereas saving alone may not provide the same level of growth. It's important to note that investing involves risk, and individuals should always carefully consider their personal financial situation before making investment decisions</p>
