<h3 class="mb-3">Spending Philosophy</h3>
<p>One effective way for someone with a problem with overspending to save money is to create a budget. This involves listing all of their income and expenses, including both necessities like housing and food, and discretionary spending like entertainment and shopping. From there, they can determine how much they can afford to set aside each month for savings and still cover their bills and necessities. Additionally, they can look for ways to reduce their expenses, such as cutting back on dining out or finding a less expensive option of what you are looking for. Another strategy for controlling overspending is to avoid impulse purchases by waiting 24 hours before making a big purchase or finding a replacement for a wanted item in a more affordable price range. Finally, they can find alternative ways to treat themselves that don't involve spending money, such as hanging out with friends or trying a new hobby. With dedication and effort, anyone can overcome overspending and start saving towards their financial goals.</p>

<p>A general rule of thumb when it comes to saving is to use the <strong>50/30/20 Rule</strong>. 50% should go towards necessities, 30% should go towards discretionary items, and 20% should go towards savings. The amount you save depends on your savings goals. There are three types of savings goals: less than one year, less than one decade, and lifetime. Less than one year goals include vacations and holiday gifts, less than one decade goals include making down payments on homes and fixing major appliances, and lifetime goals are requirements.</p>
