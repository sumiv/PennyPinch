# PocketPinch
An application created to help users gain financial literacy and insight about their spending habbits. The aim was to provide personalized money-saving tips and tricks to help users achieve their financial goals and implement effective saving strategies. Financial literacy is often a sensitive topic for families, and the stigma surrounding it can perpetuate poverty. With PocketPinch, we aim to break this barrier and promote financial literacy as a normal topic of conversation. Our hope is that users will see that saving money is nothing to be ashamed of and that they can adopt healthy money-saving habits to improve their financial well-being.

# How We Built It
We built PocketPinch in VS code using languages like HTML, CSS, and Python. We also used frameworks such as Flask and Bootstrap.

# What's Next
Our current product design does a good job of providing users with the general sense of the type of spender they are and how to save money. In the future, we'd like to increase our number of money habit personalities. Increasing the personality count would allow us to better service a wide range of people.
